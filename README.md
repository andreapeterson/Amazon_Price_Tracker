# Amazon_Price_Tracker
Requests, Beautiful Soup, and smtplib working together to alert you of price changes on an Amazon product. Owning a part-husky, this vacuum brush has been on my wishlist for the longest time. However, while at times it may feel like a necessity it certainly is not so I set up alerts to notify if the price falls below 50%. You can automate this to run at certain times and days on AWS with Lambda. Tutorial @ https://dev.to/andreapeterson/send-automated-emails-smtplib-python-through-lambda-15jk
